# what is onyx?
Onyx is a script that intuitively manages lighting and humanoid properties for ease of change in key values. You are enabled to change, within a very short time, the light intensity, color, or shadows, besides being able to edit humanoid health, speed of movement, and lots of other attributes. With this approach, you would simply customize your game to bring in the ability to fix changes in less pain.

# why?
**I** made onyx as a fun project while argon is down and i have free time. 

# how to use
Download an executor like [Salad](https://discord.gg/NbpGvpfJ29), [solara](https://getsolara.dev/) or [argon](https://getargon.xyz/)
